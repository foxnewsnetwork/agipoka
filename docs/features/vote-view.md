# Vote view

This is where the team members get together and assign a value (in whatever units that suites the team, but for the purposes of my docs, hereafter `scovilles` in fibonacci).

This page should show what everyone is voting on a bar-graph of sorts and have live updating. It is up to the SCRUM master to suggest to the team how they should point, but from my point of view, everyone should assign points based upon what a new team member with no specialized experience in the current project would be able to accomplish. This way, deviations from this number will accurate reflect how much tech-debt, and therefore fragility, has accured in the codebase.

This page will have the following feature:

- Allow team members to sensibly vote for a point value between a *selection* of possible values
