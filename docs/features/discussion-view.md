# Discussion View

The discussion view follows tightly the ticket view and is where the team members try to take turns discussing their opinions. This view alternates with the vote view until the SCRUM master is satisfied and the ticket is either pointed or throw out as unpointable

The discussion view tries to handle the following functionality:

- Allows for team members to queue for mics to speak
- Allows for team members to ask questions
- Allows for someone (either computer or a dedicated scribe or perhaps the SCRUM master) to document the discussion
