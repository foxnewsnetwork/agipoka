# Backlog View 

`v. 0.0.0-MVP`

This is *not* the full backlog and is instead the selection of the back-log that a SCRUM master (or perhaps the team) have decided would be good for inclusion to be discussed during a team meeting.

From my own experience working at SONY, this step serves as something of a filter; tickets that are considered "pointable" by the team are pointed here and ready to be slotted into the backlog. However, if they are marked blocked or otherwise thrown out as "unpointable", then it means typically that there is some misunderstanding between engineering and product, suggesting "siloing" which leads to fragillity at the company level.
