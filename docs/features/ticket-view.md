# Ticket View

This is a mobile-friendly view of a ticket. It presents pretty much what it would have in JIRA, except its main points of action for the team members are:

- Review and internalize what the ticket is asking
- Provide an estimate of when was the last time they touched this area of code
- Provide a word cloud of what this area of code touches (we will use this to index the story)
